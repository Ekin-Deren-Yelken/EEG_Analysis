# EEG_Analysis
Analysis of sleep waves

MATLAB is used to analyze and compare different stages of brain activity, namely Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) and wakefulness using the EEG signal from a patient

## Results

### Raw EEG Signal

Data is centred before being plotted.

### Spectrograms for data segments at beginning, middle, and end of data.

### Power Spectrum density of each segment

## Conclusion
Dominance of delta waves throughout the segments indicates that the patient is mostly experiencing deep NREM sleep. Some power in the theta wave frequency range indicates some fluctuating moments of lighter sleep.
The aptient appears to enter deep sleep towards the start of the study, a lighter sleep in the middle, and re-enter deep sleep towards the end.
